# CSS Typo Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in CSS: a typo in a class selector.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous CSS rule with a misspelled class name. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected code.

This illustrates the importance of careful attention to detail when writing CSS.
